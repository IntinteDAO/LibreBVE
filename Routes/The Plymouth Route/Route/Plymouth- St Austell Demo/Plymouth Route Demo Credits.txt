The version of the route you are running is: V1.7.0.0

This release focuses on rebuilding the 4km of track between Menheniot and Liskeard-
All of a sudden, I'm back where I managed to get to approximately 5 years ago!
This time around though, the quality of the route has taken a quantum leap (As well as acquiring nearly 10km of 'missing' length), and it's something that I'm proud to put my name to. Having said that, this would never have been possible without the hard work of the others in the 'Credits' section
below, as well as those whose objects have now been replaced.

Two eras are supplied- The mix of steam and dieselisation found in the mid 1960s, and the later BR Blue of the 1980s.
For practical reasons, some track layouts are based upon the 1971 rationalised layouts- This allows most of the same work to apply to all eras, with a change from semaphore to color-light signalling, and the addition/ demolition of certain buildings.

UPDATE NOTES
------------

This update requires a clean install.


FURTHER NOTES
-------------

This route has been (re)built with 3D camera angles in mind.
Unfortunately, due to the way openBVE works, some small visual artifacts may appear, but in general terms, using the external camera and panning around
will work surprisingly well!


My thanks are due to:
* All the object authours, without who this route would not have been  possible- I apologise in advance if I've vandalised your hard work beyond all recognition ;)
* Uwe Post and Thomas Tschofenig, for creating RouteBuilder, which  first got me into BVE Route coding, and has created many of the tracks etc. here.
* The members of the Train-Sim.com, Transport Forum & UKTS BVE Forums, for answering all of my  questions etc; Thanks guys!

I hope you enjoy it!

OBJECT/ CONSTRUCTION CREDITS
----------------------------

PLEASE NOTE:
This route has now been going for well over 10 years. This object list is as comprehensive as I can make it however, in the time since many objects were added I've either made major changes to the original object, or merged parts of different objects together.
This list also only includes objects built by, or based upon those by third parties.
If in doubt, please check the header of the object file in question and drop me an email.

You will also find that in recent releases, this list has been shrinking dramatically!
As I (re)build, most items are built from scratch and highly customised to fit the surroundings, oddly enough just like the real thing!

A NOTE ON COPYRIGHT
-------------------

Of late, copyright has become a rather thorny subject within the community, with threats being made over the use of objects which were freely given at the time, and the creation of certain ideas.
I will not back down in the face of baseless accusations and threats, and indeed, I have produced alternatives to these objects, and two utilities which replicate the functions of those withdrawn.

When OpenBVE was created, Michelle advocated placing everything under the public domain, in order to try and allievate this problem.

I support the aims of this initiative, although I personally prefer clearer OSS licencing. I was also there before this sim was even concieved (Anyone remember Mechanik back in 1997??),
and I refuse to let others with an agenda spoil things for the end-user.
Was this the right choice?- I don't know. It probably would have been easier to drop this altogether, and move onto something else.....

All I know, is that when I started this back in 2001, this route wouldn't have been possible without drawing on the help and hard work of others, who gave it freely in the spirit of co-operation.
I have also invested thousands of pounds into books, camera equipment and trips to the 'real' thing to pursue this hobby and bring you the route you see today.

You are welcome to use anything that I've created for this route for your own purposes, under whichever Open-Source licence you see fit, or for that matter, no credit at all.
My personal preference is for the BSD 2-Clause licence, which is what I have released the aforementioned programs under, but I'm not here to place restrictions on what you wish to do.

All I ask, is that before you release something, you take a step back and consider the hard work of those who made it possible-
Copyright, and other using your work is a priveledge, not a weapon, and I will never use it as such.

Those who choose to use foul language and baseless threats in an attempt to withdraw what was freely given, or to stop the work of others must not be given the oxygen of publicity.
